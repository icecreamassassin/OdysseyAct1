[Player] I believe I am ready to depart for Balfiera

[Auryen] Excellent. I'm having Avram see to the replacement and safeguarding of key relics in the museum, and Madras has the airship all ready to go. Let's go.

(Activating the Helm moves the Airship to Balfiera. It flies through clouds and shows the tower before descending to Gallowmarket and docking)

(Upon reaching the gate courtyard a group of people run in screaming)
[Citizen]: Dragon! A Dragon attacked Upvale! Help, you must help us

[City Guard]: Hold on there, what's this nonsence? A Dragon here, how?

[Citizen]: How am I supposed to know? He flew in from the east, probably that blasted curse from Warwych. Started raining down fire all over town, snatching up people at every turn!

[City Guard]: Calm down, we'll look into it. I'll send someone to the garrison and they'll probably send someone shortly.

[Citizen]: There's no time! By the time you get your act together everyone will be dead!
(Runs to player)
[Citizen]: You there! These fool guards aren't going to be any help! You look to be the capable sort, would you please help our fellow townsfolk while I inform the garrison?

[Player]: Dragons are my speciality, where is Upvale?

[Citizen]: Thank you!, it's just to the west of here. Go out the north gate and head to the west a bit. You'll see the devastation as soon as you come over the rise. I'll inform the Imperial Garrison at once! (Starts quest to investigate)

[Player]: I just got here...

[Citizen]: Oh nevermind! I'll inform the Garrison and maybe gather a few mercenaries if I can find them. I hope we don't arrive too late! (runs off)


(If you end up at the Garrison before the gate)

[Player]: What can you tell me about this place?

[Legate Warrington]: A lot, it depends on what you need. This isn't the chamber of commerce after all, it's an Imperial Garrison. But you seem new here, I suppose I can spare a moment or two.

This is Gallowmarket, the primary port city of the Isle of Balfiera.

[Player]: Who is in charge here?

[Legate Warrington]: Well since we are in High Rock technically, that's fairly complicated actually. Ultimately High Rock is part of the empire, so Imperials have control. However with the White Gold concordant, the Thalmor also have a presence here. The island itself is governed by the Bretonny Governor Juliar, but here on the central isle, the Direnni clan still holds sway and control the tower of Ada Mantia as well as the temple and citadel fortress up on the hill, though it's more for show than actual power anymore. I'm sure that clears it all up doesn't it?

[Player]: Where are the Thalmor?

[Legate Warrington]: They have an embassy over on the west end of the harbor

[Player]: Where is the governor?

[Legate Warrington]: Governor Juliar resides within the Direnni Palace

[Player]: What can you tell me about the Direnni?

[Legate Warrington]: Not a whole lot. They are a mixed race of Elves and Bretons who used to be incredibly powerful, but that was ages ago. Nowadys they are merely caretakers of the Adamatium Tower. They are technically their own nation here, but have been annexed by the Brettony and by affiliation, the Imperials and by the concordant the Thalmor... Like I said, it's complicated. They could tell you more up at the Citadel itself, but it's a hard hike and the road is not in the best shape.
