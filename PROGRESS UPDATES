9/13 ICA
The last few days I have been focusing on re-learning LOD development and digging into region generation. I have managed to completely generate the ferns, trees, and harvestable foliage all across the island and shore line clutter all around the island. I've done several finish up jobs on various features across the island such as the southwestern bluff which I have dubbed Marten's Bluff (a throwback to the wizardry series which I loved). Also fleshed out a couple of waterfalls and rivers that were WIP and did a quick fix up of all the doorways along the port. I'm just finalizing the region gen for harvestables at the moment and once I'm done there, I'll likely proceed with another test LOD pass and take some screen shots for preview.
- Ended up adding ocean waves and sounds. Trying to figure out where that droning sound is coming from (lighthouse?) and tone down the light as it pops in and out
